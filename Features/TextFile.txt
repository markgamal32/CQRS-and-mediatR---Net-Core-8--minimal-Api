Feature Folder: Vertical Slice Architecture
This is yet another minimal demonstration of VSA, 
or Vertical Slice Architecture, 
where we would organize our features by folders. As in, 
everything related to Product Creation would belong to the Features/Product/Commands/Create folder,
and so on. This approach makes it easier to locate and maintain code related to specific features,
as all related functionality is grouped.
This can lead to improved code organization, readability, and maintainability, especially in larger projects.

Later, I will write an article that combines VSA,
Clean Architecture, and Modular Monolith Architecture.
Let me know in the comment section if you want this article soon!
