# CQRS with MediatR and EF Core in .NET Core 8

This project is a simple demonstration of implementing the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern using **MediatR**, **EF Core**, and **In-Memory Database** in **.NET Core 8**. The project provides a sample application showcasing the benefits of the CQRS pattern in a .NET environment.

## Technologies Used:
- **.NET Core 8**
- **MediatR** for handling commands and queries
- **Entity Framework Core** with an in-memory database
- **CQRS Pattern**

What is CQRS?
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates reading and writing operations for a data store. This pattern divides the application into two parts:

Command: Responsible for changing the state of the system (write operations).
Query: Responsible for reading the state of the system (read operations).
By separating commands and queries, you can optimize each for its specific use case, such as tuning queries for performance and ensuring commands enforce business logic.

CQRS in Action
In this project:

Commands (via MediatR) are used for create, update, and delete operations.
Queries (via MediatR) are used for retrieving data from the in-memory data store.
Entity Framework Core is used as the data access layer with an in-memory database for simplicity.
Pros and Cons of CQRS
Pros:
Separation of Concerns: Read and write operations are separated, making the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
Optimized Queries: You can optimize queries for performance without affecting the command side.
Scalability: Easier to scale reads and writes independently, allowing for better performance in high-load systems.
Simpler Read Models: Queries can have simplified models tailored for the UI or client needs.
Clear Responsibility: Commands ensure business logic is centralized, while queries handle the retrieval.
Cons:
Complexity: For small applications, the overhead of maintaining separate models and handling the communication between commands and queries can be unnecessary.
Eventual Consistency: In distributed systems, ensuring consistency between the command and query models can be challenging, especially in cases requiring real-time synchronization.
More Code: Implementing CQRS results in more classes and abstractions, which can increase the initial development effort.
Future Enhancements
Implement a persistent data store (SQL or NoSQL database) instead of an in-memory database.
Add more advanced CQRS features such as event sourcing.
Include API endpoints for a real-world demonstration.
